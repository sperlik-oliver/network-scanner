A embedded software program used to detect and display surrounding network traffic on your phone using a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip

This embedded program was created using the C++/Arduino language on a ESP8266 microchip. The program can detect all surrounding traffic on the network that it is currently connected to and store the data. After that the chip switches it's network mode to Access Point and hosts a website on itself, that when connected to, allows you to view the data, including the IP and MAC adresses of the devices communicating on the network.
